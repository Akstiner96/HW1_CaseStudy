# FinTech Case Study: Knock
## Overview and Origin
---
[Knock](https://www.knock.com/) is a real estate company that is considered to be a part of the up and coming "PropTech" realm. Knock is in the business of buying and selling homes over the internet (often considered "iBuyers"), making the process quick and seamless for both parties during the arduous home buying process. 

Knock was founded in 2015 by [Sean Black](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seanblack/) and [Jamie Glenn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamieglenn/). Sean, the CEO, has a long history of working in the tech industry as his resume boasts the likes of [Trulia](https://www.trulia.com/) and SalesCrunch (who was acquired by [ClearSlide](https://www.clearslide.com/)). Knock's COO, Jamie Glenn, has an equally impressive resume with history at [Yahoo!](https://www.yahoo.com/), Trulia, and [JobVite](https://www.jobvite.com/).

With two industry leaders at the helm, it's easy to see why and how Knock got started. Buying and selling a home is a long and complicated process, often eased by real estate agents and their respective company. Even with help from an agent, ownership, loan, and contract paperwork can pile up. Sean and Jamie saw a problem, and presented their solution, Knock. 

In January 2019, Knock completed their Series B round and amassed an impressive $400 million. The funding came from VentureCapital groups and individuals alike, including [FoundryGroup](https://www.foundrygroup.com/) and [Great Oaks Venture Capital](http://www.greatoaksvc.com/).

## Business Activities

According to Knock's [mission statement](https://www.knock.com/about-us):
> Homeownership is the symbol of the American dream, but ironically it is often what holds people back. Our home is our largest purchase and most valuable asset, but it is also the most difficult to buy and sell. Traditional U.S. residential real estate is complex and outdated, making it stressful, expensive and time-consuming for the average consumer to buy and sell homes.

Knock's goal is to make home buying more managable for those that are also trying to sell a home. Often times life inserts itself into already complicated process', people need to move homes quickly due to various reasons, leaving their current place empty and unsold. The masterminds at Knock gave the thousands that struggle with this an easy solution, tell Knock which home you want to buy and they will purchase your new home _in cash_.

What sets Knock apart from other 'iBuyers' is that they are not technically an iBuyer. Knock does not purchase your home from you like other similar companies, instead, they buy your new home, repair and sell your old, then transfer the new deed into your name once your old home has sold. By being a third party and holding the ability to purchase a home in cash, Knock is considered a "non-contingent" buyer. This means they can often get their clients a discount on the home that they otherwise wouldn't be able to receive.

Knock boasts an algorithm that will ["sell your home in less than six weeks, even if Knock has to buy it"](https://hypepotamus.com/companies/knock/). However, their secrets appear to be closely guarded. The aformentioned "algorithm" pulls public data on homes and uses it alongside extra info from the owner to provide them with a "narrow" price point. This allows people to know exactly how much thier home is worth, saving loads of money and time. What platform their algorithm runs on, however, does not appear to be publicly available knowledge.
